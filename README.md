#Frontend-design-Contest

This app is built using reactJs framework and the main componenets are coded under the App.Js file. 

The Style.css accomodates the styling required for this website based on the figma template given.

The images and vectors used are placed under the assets folder.

Entire accuracy of the website template wasn't achieved due to time and resource constraints but I have tried to replicate it as much as possible. As a future prospect I will be able to succesfully complete the same. I am aware of react events, the concept of flexboard and the necessary css to bring in full functionality to the website as well in due time.
